Shortest Path Routing Protocol for NS3

written by Junseok KIM, last updated Dec 23, 2011

When you develop or evaluate MAC protocols in an ad-hoc network, you may need a simple routing protocol, helping you only focus on the MAC performance.
Currently, NS3 provides only AODV routing protocol for wireless systems. The AODV implementation follows the RFC standard, so it requires to exchange many packets to establish routes.

I implemented the shortest path routing protocol on NS3. This protocol does not generate any packet.
All nodes share the routing table. By users' command, the shortest paths between all pairs are obtained using Floyd-Warshall algorithm, and stored in the table.

I did not use it for mobile networks, but it can be used in a mobile scenario by updating the routing table often.
You can learn how to use it by reading an example script.
